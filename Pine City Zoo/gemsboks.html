          <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
          <p>
            Gemsboks are large antelopes found in the arid regions of southern
            Africa. They are known for their striking appearance, with long,
            straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern.
            Gemsboks are well adapted to their harsh environment, able to
            withstand high temperatures and go for long periods without water.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gemsboks are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and browsing
            on shrubs. They are social animals, often forming herds of up to 20
            individuals. During the hottest parts of the day, gemsboks seek
            shade and rest, becoming more active during the cooler morning and
            evening hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gemsboks are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats
            including savannahs, grasslands, and arid regions. They prefer to
            stay near water sources.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the gemsboks at pen E23, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
