          <h3>KOALA</h3>
          <p>
            Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their
            distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling habits. They have a
            stocky body, large head, and round, fluffy ears. Koalas are
            primarily herbivorous, feeding on eucalyptus leaves, which
            provide them with the necessary nutrients.
          </p>
          <p>
            These animals are well-adapted to their arboreal lifestyle,
            with strong limbs and sharp claws for climbing. Koalas are
            mostly nocturnal, spending the majority of their time sleeping
            in trees to conserve energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koalas are social animals and often live in groups called
            "clans." They communicate through a variety of vocalizations,
            including grunts and bellows.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the koalas at pen E23, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
