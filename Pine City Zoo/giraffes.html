          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>
            Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks
            and legs. They are native to Africa and inhabit savannahs and open
            woodlands. Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves,
            fruits, and flowers from trees.
            

          </p>
          <p>
            Their long necks allow them to reach high branches, giving them
            access to food sources that other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes
            have a unique coat pattern, with irregular brown patches on a
            lighter background, which helps them blend into their surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giraffes are social animals and live in loose herds. They are
            known for their gentle demeanor and are often seen interacting
            with one another.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the giraffes at pen E26, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
