          <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
          <p>
            Warthogs are wild pigs found in Africa, known for their distinctive
            appearance with large tusks and a rugged body. They inhabit savannahs,
            grasslands, and woodlands, often near water sources. Warthogs are
            well-adapted to their environment, using their strong legs to dig
            for roots and tubers.
          </p>
          <p>
            These animals are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses,
            fruits, and bark. They have a unique way of foraging, often
            using their snouts to root around in the soil. Warthogs are also
            known for their social behavior, often seen in groups called
            sounders, which consist of females and their young.
          </p>
          <p>
            Warthogs are not currently considered endangered, but they face
            threats from habitat loss and hunting. Conservation efforts are
            in place to protect their natural habitats and ensure their
            survival in the wild.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the warthogs at pen E25, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
