          <h3>TIGER</h3>
          <p>
            Tigers are the largest cat species in the world and are known for
            their striking orange coat with black stripes. They are native to
            Asia and can be found in a variety of habitats, including
            tropical forests, grasslands, and savannahs. Tigers are solitary
            hunters and are primarily active at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            These magnificent animals are apex predators, preying on large
            ungulates such as deer and wild boar. Tigers are known for their
            powerful build and strong jaws, which allow them to take down
            prey much larger than themselves. They are also excellent swimmers
            and often hunt in water.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tigers are classified as endangered, with habitat loss and
            poaching posing significant threats to their survival. Conservation
            efforts are underway to protect their natural habitat and ensure
            their survival in the wild.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the tigers at pen E30, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
