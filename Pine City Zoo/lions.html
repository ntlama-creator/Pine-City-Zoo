          <h3>LION</h3>
          <p>
            Lions are large carnivorous mammals that belong to the family
            Felidae. They are known for their majestic appearance, with males
            sporting a distinctive mane. Lions are social animals, living in
            groups called prides, which typically consist of related females,
            their cubs, and a small number of adult males.
          </p>
          <p>
            These powerful predators primarily hunt large ungulates, such as
            zebras and wildebeests, using teamwork and strategy to bring down
            their prey. Lions are also known for their impressive vocalizations,
            including roars that can be heard over long distances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lions are found in a variety of habitats, including savannahs,
            grasslands, and open woodlands. They are most commonly associated
            with the African continent, although a small population of Asiatic
            lions exists in the Gir Forest of India.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the lions at pen E26, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
