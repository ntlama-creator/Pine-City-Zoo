          <h3>GORILLA</h3>
          <p>
            Gorillas are the largest living primates and are native to the
            forests of central Africa. They are ground-dwelling and primarily
            herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, and fruit. Gorillas are
            highly social animals, living in groups led by a dominant male
            known as a silverback.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two species of gorillas: the eastern gorilla and the
            western gorilla. Both species are critically endangered due to
            habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts are
            underway to protect these magnificent animals and their habitats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gorillas are known for their intelligence and complex social
            structures. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations,
            gestures, and facial expressions. Despite their size and strength,
            gorillas are generally gentle and shy animals.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the gorillas at pen E24, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
