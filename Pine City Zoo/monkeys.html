          <h3>MONKEY</h3>
          <p>
            Monkeys are primates that are known for their playful behavior and
            intelligence. They are found in various habitats, including tropical
            rainforests, savannahs, and mountainous regions. Monkeys are
            social animals and often live in groups called troops.
          </p>
          <p>
            These animals are highly adaptable and have a varied diet that
            includes fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals. Monkeys are
            known for their dexterous hands and feet, which allow them to
            navigate through trees with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monkeys communicate using a range of vocalizations, facial
            expressions, and body language. They are also known for their
            playful antics, which can include swinging from branches, chasing
            each other, and engaging in grooming behaviors.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the monkeys at pen E27, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
