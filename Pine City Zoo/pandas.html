          <h3>PANDA</h3>
          <p>
            Pandas are large bears native to China, known for their distinctive
            black and white coloring. They primarily inhabit bamboo forests,
            where they spend most of their time eating bamboo shoots and leaves.
            Pandas are solitary animals, and their diet consists almost entirely
            of bamboo, which makes up about 99% of their food intake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have adapted to a
            herbivorous diet. They have strong jaws and teeth that allow them to
            crush tough bamboo stalks. Pandas are also known for their playful
            behavior, often seen rolling around and climbing trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pandas are considered a vulnerable species, with habitat loss and
            fragmentation posing significant threats to their survival. Conservation
            efforts are underway to protect their natural habitat and ensure their
            survival in the wild.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You will find the pandas at pen E20, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
